# Welcome to the Instructor Blog

If you wanted to check out the main blog check us out [here](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/) where we have a bunch of posts about Instructor and OpenAI, and how to think about building with structured prompting. This blog will be more focused on the technical details of the javascript library.
