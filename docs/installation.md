Installation is as simple as:

!!! warning
    "We haven't released instructor-js to npm yet. Please directly clone the repository and use"
    
```bash
npm install instructor-js
```

Instructor-js has a few dependencies:

- [`openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai): OpenAI's  TypeScript / JavaScript library.
- [`zod`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod): TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

If you've got Typescript 5.3.3+ installed, you're good to go.
