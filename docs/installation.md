Installation is as simple as:

```bash
npm install @instructor-ai/instructor
```

Instructor-js has a few dependencies:

- [`openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai): OpenAI's  TypeScript / JavaScript library.
- [`zod`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod): TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

If you've got Typescript 5.3.3+ installed, you're good to go.
